GonePhishing is a phishing attachment toolkit written in Python.  
The tools main purpose is to allow you to create custom payloads in common file formats (PDF, Office Documents, etc.) allowing you, a PenTester, to test the most vulnerable asset your company faces; the end user.

*Disclaimer: This tool is meant for security research and penetration tests **only** any other usage is unauthorized, any modifications of the tool other than by the Owner (Myself) is not allowed.*

*If you are caught using this toolkit in a malicious manner I am not liable, you are, use common sense and make sure you have **written** permission before a penetration test.* 

# Update
I am happy to announce that I have been developing an executable building toolkit named "ExecuPhish".

Upon completion of the toolkit you will be able to create an executable with a few simple keystrokes!

The sub-folder ExecuPhish will contain all tool specific information such as the README as well as the finished toolkit!

# Installation
```

```
# Usage
```

```
# Configuration
```

```
# To Do List
1. Create the README
2. Start creating tool templates
3. Initialize the creation of version 0.1.1
4. Perform initial testing in a lab environment (will post results in Github or website)


# NOTE
I know I definitely dropped the ball on this, tbh I haven't spent any time doing cybersecurity let alone coding so idk when this initial code publish will happen
I'm very new to Python so this may be a project for later down the line
